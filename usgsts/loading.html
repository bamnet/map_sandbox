    This page explores the ordering of how the API is loaded. Looking at your
    console, you'll see a variety of log statements from various points in the
    loading process.
  </p>
  <p>
    In my tests, the sequence is:
    <ol>
      <li>google.maps is set</li>
      <li>google.maps.MODULE_NAMEs are set</li>
      <li>&callback= is executed</li>
      <li>&gt;script&lt; onLoad is executed</li>
      <li>async code from google.maps being set is executed</li>
      <li>async code from google.maps.MODULE_NAMEs is executed</li>
    </ol>
  </p>
  <p>
    I interpret this to mean that the JS API is loaded as one big synchronous
    block, with the callback executed as the final step in the loading process.
    When it finished loading, the browser resumes the expected event-loop,
    triggering onload and any async code waiting on the stack.

  <script src="src/loading.ts"></script>
  <script
    type="text/javascript" onload="onScriptLoad()"
    async defer
    src="http://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/js?v=3&key=AIzaSyAX2ZNfyW_XMZr1IuibCAZ66lXlj9bXz-Q&callback=callback"></script>
