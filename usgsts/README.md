# Experimental TypeScript Module Stuff

This folder houses a bunch of small demos / examples to help us explore how
TypeScript modules that depend on the Maps JS APi might be built in the future.

## Running

To start running the code:

```
parcel index.html
```

Visit http://localhost:1234/. If you want to run this somewhere outside of
localhost:1234, bring your own API key.
